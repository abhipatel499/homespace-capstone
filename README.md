# Homespace Data Acquisition - UML Capstone

## Overview

This capstone project is for [UMass Chan Medical School](https://www.umassmed.edu/) where they tasked UML students to deliver a system capable of measuring a patient’s Homespace (the daily patterns of an individual’s movement in their home) and detecting the presence of sleep apnea (disorder causing one to suddenly wake up).

## Installing the libraries

This project uses several important libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more. You can install them all by running the following commands with pip:

```bash 
pip install pandas
pip install numpy

python -m pip install -U matplotlib
pip install seaborn

pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow

```

If you are not able to install the necessary libraries, I recommend you **use Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda**. I have a .ipynb file for the project as well.
