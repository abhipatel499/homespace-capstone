# Homespace Data Acquisition - UML Capstone
This capstone project is for [UMass Chan Medical School](https://www.umassmed.edu/) where they tasked UML students to deliver a system capable of measuring a patient’s Homespace (the daily patterns of an individual’s movement in their home) and detecting the presence of sleep apnea (disorder causing one to suddenly wake up). Using the project description we have many key characteristics for our system:

 - Non-invasive and simple setup process
 - Datastreams are selective for the patient under observation
 - Scalable, leveraging existing data collection devices and open-source software
 - Little to no effort required from patient for system’s functionality
